By a careful examination of my watch and the sun 's altitude , I was able to calculate what would , in all likelihood , have been his height above yonder waves when her chair was turned toward the city , at a point I reached in the track . But of the matter then simultaneously occupying my mind , to recover which was the second supreme task I proposed to myself-of what . I also was thinking upon the stroke of five o'clock , I could recollect nothing . I could not even recollect whether I happened to be looking on sun and waves when she must have had them full and glorious in her face . With the heartiest consent I could give , and a blank cheque , my father returned to England to hire forthwith a commodious yacht , fitted and manned . Before going he discoursed of prudence in our expenditure ; though not for the sake of the mere money in hand , which was a trifle , barely more than the half of my future income ; but that the squire , should he by and by bethink him of inspecting our affairs , might perceive we were not spendthrifts .",

The day before a midsummer storm had vexed the soul of the silver streak , which had turned to a grey pewter streak of a peculiarly streaky nature , with white tops to the waves that slung themselves over the head of the pier . Cabin-boys and stewards were making horrible dispositions of tinware , and the head steward was on the verge of distraction , since the whole world seemed to have chosen this particular day to return to England , and the whole world , with an eye on the Channel , desired private cabins , which were numerically less than the demand .

So the past had no sting left , and if iron had ever entered into her soul it now but served to make it strong . She was still young , too ; it was not near sunset with her yet , nor even midday , and the future that , humanly speaking , she counted to be hers was almost dazzling in its brightness . For love had dawned for her again , and no uncertain love , wrapped in the mists of memory , but one that had ripened through liking and friendship and intimacy into the authentic glory .

Into one of these tall tenement buildings , its ugliness rendered more ugly by the network of iron fire-escape ladders that writhed up the face of it , Spike led the way , first into a dark hallway and thence up many stairs that echoed to their light-treading feet -- on and up , past dimly lit landings where were doors each of which shut in its own little world , a world distinct and separate wherein youth and age , good and evil , joy and misery , lived and moved and had their being ; behind these dingy panels were smiling hope and black despair , blooming health and pallid sickness , and all those sins and virtues that go to make up the sum total of humanity . Something of all this was in Geoffrey Ravenslee 's mind as he climbed the dingy , interminable stair behind Spike , who presently halted to get his wind and whisper : `` It ai n't much further now , Geoff , only another two flights and -- '' He stopped suddenly to listen , and from the landing above a sound reached them , a sound soft but unmistakable -- a woman 's muffled sobbing .",

Upon the boat he was again conscious of a round head that bobbed here and there amid the throng of passengers , but paid small heed as he leaned to watch the broad and noble river and the green New Jersey shore . At Fort Lee , exchanging boat for trolley car , he was once more vaguely conscious of two round eyes that watched him from a rear seat ; but as the powerful car whirled them up-hill , plunged them down steep inclines , swung them around sharp curves , through shady woods , past far-flung boughs whose leaves stirred and whispered as the great car fleeted by , he fell again to dreaming of Hermione and the future ; and so reached Englewood , a small township dreaming in the fierce midday sunshine . Here he enquired of a perspiring butcher in shirtsleeves the whereabouts of the house he wanted and , being fully directed and carefully admonished how to get there , set off along the road . And remembering that her feet must often have traversed this very path , he straightway fell to his dreaming again .

One mile of such traveling , with a weight to draw and no firm footing , would take more out of us than four on a good road ; every nerve and muscle of our bodies is on the strain to keep our balance ; and , added to this , the fear of falling is more exhausting than anything else . If the roads are very bad indeed our shoes are roughed , but that makes us feel nervous at first .",

Now three well-known facts occur to me in connection with this stone of the House of Saul : the first , that Saladin met in battle , and defeated , _ and plundered _ , in a certain place , on a certain day , this Hasn-us-Sabah , or one of his successors bearing the same name ; the second , that about this time there was a cordial _ rapprochement _ between Saladin and Richard the Lion , and between the Infidels and the Christians generally , during which a free interchange of gems , then regarded as of deep mystic importance , took place -- remember `` The Talisman , '' and the `` Lee Penny '' ; the third , that soon after the fighters of Richard , and then himself , returned to England , the Loculus or coffin of St. Edmund -LRB- as we are informed by the _ Jocelini Chronica _ -RRB- was _ opened by the Abbot _ at midnight , and the body of the martyr exposed . On such occasions it was customary to place gems and relics in the coffin , when it was again closed up . Now , the chalice with the stone was taken from this loculus ; and is it possible not to believe that some knight , to whom it had been presented by one of Saladin 's men , had in turn presented it to the monastery , first scratching uncouthly on its surface the name of Hasn to mark its semi-sacred origin , or perhaps bidding the monks to do so ? But the Assassins , now called , I think , `` al Hasani '' or `` Ismaili '' -- `` that accursed _ Ishmaelite _ , '' the baronet exclaims in one place -- still live , are still a flourishing sect impelled by fervid religious fanaticisms .",

'' Can you not picture the distracted old man seeking ever and anon with absent mind for his long-accustomed head-gear , and seeking in vain ? Of the gown , too , we may be equally certain : for it was the procuring of this that led Ul-Jabal to the baronet 's trunk ; we now know that he did not go there to _ hide _ the stone , for he had it not to hide ; nor to _ seek _ it , for he would be unable to believe the baronet childish enough to deposit it in so obvious a place .

Along its two edges , like great saw teeth , fragments of obsidian , about three inches long and two inches wide , were inserted ; and as these were keenly sharp the weapon was a most ferocious one .

On arch\u00e6ological grounds , the sight of this chimney greatly astonished me ; and Rayburn , who was a very well-read man in all matters connected with his profession , was greatly astonished by it also ; for the chimney obviously was a part of extensive reduction-works , and we both knew that such complete appliances for the smelting of metal , as seemed from this sign to exist here , were supposed to be the product of a high state of civilization in comparatively modern times .

It might be about three o'clock in the afternoon , when I found myself on some heathy land near the sea , on the ridge of a hill , the side of which , nearly as far down as the sea , was heath ; but on the top there was arable ground , which had been planted , and from which the harvest had been gathered -- oats or barley , I know not which -- but I remember that the ground was covered with stubble . Well , about three o'clock , as I told you before , what with the heat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a lazy way , I felt very tired ; so I determined to have a sleep , and I laid myself down , my head just on the ridge of the hill , towards the field , and my body over the side down amongst the heath ; my bag , which was nearly filled with creatures , lay at a little distance from my face ; the creatures were struggling in it , I remember , and I thought to myself , how much more comfortably off I was than they ; I was taking my ease on the nice open hill , cooled with the breezes , whilst they were in the nasty close bag , coiling about one another , and breaking their very hearts , all to no purpose : and I felt quite comfortable and happy in the thought , and little by little closed my eyes , and fell into the sweetest snooze that ever I was in in all my life ; and there I lay over the hill 's side , with my head half in the field , I do n't know how long , all dead asleep . At last it seemed to me that I heard a noise in my sleep , something like a thing moving , very faint , however , far away ; then it died , and then it came again upon my ear as I slept , and now it appeared almost as if I heard crackle , crackle ; then it died again , or I became yet more dead asleep than before , I know not which , but I certainly lay some time without hearing it . All of a sudden I became awake , and there was I , on the ridge of the hill , with my cheek on the ground towards the stubble , with a noise in my ear like that of something moving towards me , amongst the stubble of the field ; well , I lay a moment or two listening to the noise , and then I became frightened , for I did not like the noise at all , it sounded so odd ; so I rolled myself on my belly , and looked towards the stubble .",

On the fourth day the sun shone brightly -- I arose , and , having breakfasted as usual , I fell to work . My brain was this day wonderfully prolific , and my pen never before or since glided so rapidly over the paper ; towards night I began to feel strangely about the back part of my head , and my whole system was extraordinarily affected .

I have even rushed away from the object , but I was sure to return , the impulse was too strong to be resisted : I quickly hurried back , compelled by the feeling within me to touch the object . Now I need not tell you that what impelled me to these actions was the desire to prevent my mother 's death ; whenever I touched any particular object , it was with the view of baffling the evil chance , as you would call it -- in this instance my mother 's death . `` A favourable crisis occurred in my mother 's complaint , and she recovered ; this crisis took place about six o'clock in the morning ; almost simultaneously with it there happened to myself a rather remarkable circumstance connected with the nervous feeling which was rioting in my system . I was lying in bed in a kind of uneasy doze , the only kind of rest which my anxiety , on account of my mother , permitted me at this time to take , when all at once I sprang up as if electrified , the mysterious impulse was upon me , and it urged me to go without delay , and climb a stately elm behind the house , and touch the topmost branch ; otherwise -- you know the rest -- the evil chance would prevail .

The demoniac influence , for I can call it nothing else , at length prevailed ; it compelled me to rise , to dress myself , to descend the stairs , to unbolt the door , and to go forth ; it drove me to the foot of the tree , and it compelled me to climb the trunk ; this was a tremendous task , and I only accomplished it after repeated falls and trials .",

Paul Patoff had not yet reached the quiet haven of his hopes , and I have not reached the end of my story . It would indeed be a very easy matter , as I have said before , to collect all the things which happened to him into a neat romance , of which the action should not cover more than four-and-twenty hours of such excitement as no one of the actors could have borne in real life , any more than Salvini could act a tragedy which should begin at noon to-day and end at midday to-morrow . I might have divested Paul of many of his surroundings , have bereaved him of many of his friends , and made him do himself what others did to him ; but if he were to read such an account of his life he would laugh scornfully , and say that the real thing was very different indeed , as without doubt it was . This is the reason why I have not hesitated to bring before you a great number of personages , each of whom , in a great or a small way , affected his life . I do not believe that you could understand his actions in the sequel without knowing the details of those situations through which he had passed before .",

Finally , he had proposed , after anxious consideration , that Miss Pross and Jerry , who were at liberty to leave the city , should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period . Unencumbered with luggage , they would soon overtake the coach , and , passing it and preceding it on the road , would order its horses in advance , and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night , when delay was the most to be dreaded . Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency , Miss Pross hailed it with joy . She and Jerry had beheld the coach start , had known who it was that Solomon brought , had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense , and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach , even as Madame Defarge , taking her way through the streets , now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation .",

Take me in at the cathedral , at Three o'Clock , or as near it as you can , and I am sure it will be better than our going from here . I feel certain of it . There ! Bless you , Mr. Cruncher !",

She had no time to lose , but must get ready at once . Afraid , in her extreme perturbation , of the loneliness of the deserted rooms , and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them , Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes , which were swollen and red . Haunted by her feverish apprehensions , she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water , but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her .",

Feeling safe within his thorny enclosure , Mugambi was wont to stretch himself in the shade of his shelter during the heat of the day , and sleep in peaceful security until the declining sun carried with it the enervating temperature of midday . Watching from above , Chulk saw the black warrior stretched thus in the unconsciousness of sleep one sultry afternoon . Creeping out upon an overhanging branch the anthropoid dropped to the ground within the boma . He approached the sleeper upon padded feet which gave forth no sound , and with an uncanny woodcraft that rustled not a leaf or a grass blade .",

If he was indeed the messenger , he must have been content with a very short rest for his horse after delivering the note to Monsieur de Merri ; -- must have started from Sabl\u00e9 as soon as , or little later than , Monsieur de Merri himself , to be in La Fl\u00e8che on the same evening that gentleman arrived there , and to be out of it again before I was , as he must have been if he reached Le Lude by midnight . Perhaps he was passing through La Fl\u00e8che at the very time the duel was going on ; but the sum of all was , that he could not know Monsieur de Merri was killed , and this I felt to be fortunate for me . Another thought which I had while following him along the straight white road that day , was that if the lady could command the services of this able young fellow to bear a message so far , why could she not use him directly for the saving of her life and honour ? Evidently there was a reason why mere zeal and ability would not suffice .",

And wild bloody work it had been .

For all these Reasons together , I say , the Parson of the Parish intended to serve Trim in this Matter to the utmost of his Power : All that was wanting was previously to inquire , if any one had a Claim to it ; -- or whether , as it had , Time immemorial , hung up in the Church , the taking it down might not raise a Clamour in the Parish . These Inquiries were the very Thing that Trim dreaded in his Heart -- He knew very well that if the Parson should but say one Word to the Church - Wardens about it , there would be an End of the whole Affair . For this , and some other Reasons not necessary to be told you , at present , Trim was for allowing no Time in this Matter ; -- but , on the contrary , doubled his Diligence and Importunity at the Vicarage-House ; -- plagued the whole Family to Death ; -- pressed his Suit Morning , Noon , and Night ; and , to shorten my Story , teazed the poor Gentleman , who was but in an ill State of Health , almost out of his Life about it . You will not wonder , when I tell you , that all this Hurry and Precipitation , on the Side of Master Trim , produced its natural Effect on the Side of the Parson , and that was , a Suspicion that all was not right at the Bottom . He was one Evening sitting alone in his Study , weighing and turning this Doubt every Way in his Mind ; and , after an Hour and a half 's serious Deliberation upon the Affair , and running over Trim 's Behaviour throughout , -- he was just saying to himself , It must be so ; -- when a sudden Rap at the Door put an End to his Soliloquy , -- and , in a few Minutes , to his Doubts too ; for a Labourer in the Town , who deem 'd himself past his fifty-second Year , had been returned by the Constable in the Militia-List , -- and he had come , with a Groat in his Hand , to search the Parish Register for his Age . -- The Parson bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket , and go into the Kitchen : -- Then shutting the Study Door , and taking down the Parish Register , -- Who knows , says he , but I may find something here about this self-same Watch-Coat ?",

He had , of course , the breaker of water that was part of his regular equipment ; but this was more for use during a long day of fishing than for the emergency of being lost at sea . He took a hearty drink and prepared for the long watch of the night . By a wax match several hours later he found that it was midnight . His struggle with wind and sea had now become unequal . He found it impractical to remain longer in the stern attempting to scull . So very cautiously he set about his last defensive measure .",

Just beyond Long Island a low stratum of miasmic gray was the only shred of the usual fog to be seen on the whole horizon . In the little roadstead the vessels , black-hulled or white , rode eagerly and gracefully at their moorings , the bright sun bringing out the red , yellow , green , blue , and brown of the dories nested amidships . At seven o'clock the steamer _ Grande Mignon _ blew a great blast of her whistle , cast off her lines , and cleared for St. Andrew 's and St. Stephens . Tooting a long , last salute , she rolled out into Fundy and out of sight around the point . For these men breakfast was long past , but there were the myriad last details that could not be left undone ; and it was fully eight o'clock before the last dory was swung aboard and the last barrel stowed . Then there came the clicking of many windlasses and the strain of many ropes , and to the women and girls who lined the shore these noises were as the beatings of the executioner 's hand upon the cell-door of a condemned man .",
