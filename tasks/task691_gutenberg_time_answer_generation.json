By a careful examination of my watch and the sun 's altitude , I was able to calculate what would , in all likelihood , have been his height above yonder waves when her chair was turned toward the city , at a point I reached in the track . But of the matter then simultaneously occupying my mind , to recover which was the second supreme task I proposed to myself-of what . I also was thinking upon the stroke of five o'clock , I could recollect nothing . I could not even recollect whether I happened to be looking on sun and waves when she must have had them full and glorious in her face . With the heartiest consent I could give , and a blank cheque , my father returned to England to hire forthwith a commodious yacht , fitted and manned . Before going he discoursed of prudence in our expenditure ; though not for the sake of the mere money in hand , which was a trifle , barely more than the half of my future income ; but that the squire , should he by and by bethink him of inspecting our affairs , might perceive we were not spendthrifts .",

The day before a midsummer storm had vexed the soul of the silver streak , which had turned to a grey pewter streak of a peculiarly streaky nature , with white tops to the waves that slung themselves over the head of the pier . Cabin-boys and stewards were making horrible dispositions of tinware , and the head steward was on the verge of distraction , since the whole world seemed to have chosen this particular day to return to England , and the whole world , with an eye on the Channel , desired private cabins , which were numerically less than the demand .

Sorrow had increased her own power of sympathy ; out of trials she had learnt patience ; and failure and the gradual sinking of one she had loved into the bottomless slough of evil habit had but left her with an added dower of pity and tolerance . So the past had no sting left , and if iron had ever entered into her soul it now but served to make it strong . She was still young , too ; it was not near sunset with her yet , nor even midday , and the future that , humanly speaking , she counted to be hers was almost dazzling in its brightness . For love had dawned for her again , and no uncertain love , wrapped in the mists of memory , but one that had ripened through liking and friendship and intimacy into the authentic glory .

Into one of these tall tenement buildings , its ugliness rendered more ugly by the network of iron fire-escape ladders that writhed up the face of it , Spike led the way , first into a dark hallway and thence up many stairs that echoed to their light-treading feet -- on and up , past dimly lit landings where were doors each of which shut in its own little world , a world distinct and separate wherein youth and age , good and evil , joy and misery , lived and moved and had their being ; behind these dingy panels were smiling hope and black despair , blooming health and pallid sickness , and all those sins and virtues that go to make up the sum total of humanity . Something of all this was in Geoffrey Ravenslee 's mind as he climbed the dingy , interminable stair behind Spike , who presently halted to get his wind and whisper : `` It ai n't much further now , Geoff , only another two flights and -- '' He stopped suddenly to listen , and from the landing above a sound reached them , a sound soft but unmistakable -- a woman 's muffled sobbing .",

Upon the boat he was again conscious of a round head that bobbed here and there amid the throng of passengers , but paid small heed as he leaned to watch the broad and noble river and the green New Jersey shore . At Fort Lee , exchanging boat for trolley car , he was once more vaguely conscious of two round eyes that watched him from a rear seat ; but as the powerful car whirled them up-hill , plunged them down steep inclines , swung them around sharp curves , through shady woods , past far-flung boughs whose leaves stirred and whispered as the great car fleeted by , he fell again to dreaming of Hermione and the future ; and so reached Englewood , a small township dreaming in the fierce midday sunshine . Here he enquired of a perspiring butcher in shirtsleeves the whereabouts of the house he wanted and , being fully directed and carefully admonished how to get there , set off along the road . And remembering that her feet must often have traversed this very path , he straightway fell to his dreaming again .

Dinah 's family lived in a small farmhouse , up a green lane , close by a meadow with some fine shady trees ; there were two cows feeding in it . A young man asked Jerry to bring his trap into the meadow , and he would tie me up in the cowshed ; he wished he had a better stable to offer .",

It was rowed by a waterman , and in the stern-sheets there sat a figure the sight of which caused Tristram 's heart to stop beating for a moment , and then to resume at a gallop .

It was changeful and changeless . He thought he knew its effects by heart , but it had always new ones in reserve to surprise and delight him . He declared it at last to be inexhaustible .",

The Red Cross Knights called him Shaikh-ul-Jabal -- the Old Man of the Mountains , that very nickname connecting him infallibly with the Ul-Jabal of our own times . Now three well-known facts occur to me in connection with this stone of the House of Saul : the first , that Saladin met in battle , and defeated , _ and plundered _ , in a certain place , on a certain day , this Hasn-us-Sabah , or one of his successors bearing the same name ; the second , that about this time there was a cordial _ rapprochement _ between Saladin and Richard the Lion , and between the Infidels and the Christians generally , during which a free interchange of gems , then regarded as of deep mystic importance , took place -- remember `` The Talisman , '' and the `` Lee Penny '' ; the third , that soon after the fighters of Richard , and then himself , returned to England , the Loculus or coffin of St. Edmund -LRB- as we are informed by the _ Jocelini Chronica _ -RRB- was _ opened by the Abbot _ at midnight , and the body of the martyr exposed . On such occasions it was customary to place gems and relics in the coffin , when it was again closed up . Now , the chalice with the stone was taken from this loculus ; and is it possible not to believe that some knight , to whom it had been presented by one of Saladin 's men , had in turn presented it to the monastery , first scratching uncouthly on its surface the name of Hasn to mark its semi-sacred origin , or perhaps bidding the monks to do so ? But the Assassins , now called , I think , `` al Hasani '' or `` Ismaili '' -- `` that accursed _ Ishmaelite _ , '' the baronet exclaims in one place -- still live , are still a flourishing sect impelled by fervid religious fanaticisms .",

It truly was a maccuahuitl , the primitive Aztec sword , but very unlike any description of that weapon that I had ever seen . The maccuahuitl , as described by the Spaniards at the time of the conquest and as shown by the Aztec pictures of it preserved in various museums , was a wooden blade from three and a half to four feet long and from four to five inches wide . Along its two edges , like great saw teeth , fragments of obsidian , about three inches long and two inches wide , were inserted ; and as these were keenly sharp the weapon was a most ferocious one . The sword that I held in my hand was identical in its essential features with this primitive design ; but it was shorter , narrower , and thinner .

Their father talked of going , too , but ten years later he still dragged himself spectrally about the labors of the farm , with the same cough at sixty which made his oldest son at twenty-nine look scarcely younger than himself . One soft noon in the middle of August the farmer came in from the corn-field that an early frost had blighted , and told his wife that they must give it up . He said , in his weak , hoarse voice , with the catarrhal catching in it , that it was no use trying to make a living on the farm any longer . The oats had hardly been worth cutting , and now the corn was gone , and there was not hay enough without it to winter the stock ; if they got through themselves they would have to live on potatoes . Have a vendue , and sell out everything before the snow flew , and let the State take the farm and get what it could for it , and turn over the balance that was left after the taxes ; the interest of the savings-bank mortgage would soon eat that up .",

About midnight I awoke , as if from a troubled sleep , and beheld my parents bending over my couch , whilst the regimental surgeon , with a candle in his hand , stood nigh , the light feebly reflected on the whitewashed walls of the barrack-room . Another circumstance connected with my infancy , and I have done . I need offer no apology for relating it , as it subsequently exercised considerable influence over my pursuits . We were , if I remember right , in the vicinity of a place called Hythe , in Kent .",

It consisted , if I remember right , of some five or six casernes , very long , and immensely high ; each standing isolated from the rest , upon a spot of ground which might average ten acres , and which was fenced round with lofty palisades , the whole being compassed about by a towering wall , beneath which , at intervals , on both sides , sentinels were stationed , whilst outside , upon the field , stood commodious wooden barracks , capable of containing two regiments of infantry , intended to serve as guards upon the captives . Such was the station or prison at Norman Cross , where some six thousand French and other foreigners , followers of the grand Corsican , were now immured .",

I have even rushed away from the object , but I was sure to return , the impulse was too strong to be resisted : I quickly hurried back , compelled by the feeling within me to touch the object . Now I need not tell you that what impelled me to these actions was the desire to prevent my mother 's death ; whenever I touched any particular object , it was with the view of baffling the evil chance , as you would call it -- in this instance my mother 's death . `` A favourable crisis occurred in my mother 's complaint , and she recovered ; this crisis took place about six o'clock in the morning ; almost simultaneously with it there happened to myself a rather remarkable circumstance connected with the nervous feeling which was rioting in my system . I was lying in bed in a kind of uneasy doze , the only kind of rest which my anxiety , on account of my mother , permitted me at this time to take , when all at once I sprang up as if electrified , the mysterious impulse was upon me , and it urged me to go without delay , and climb a stately elm behind the house , and touch the topmost branch ; otherwise -- you know the rest -- the evil chance would prevail . Accustomed for some time as I had been , under this impulse , to perform extravagant actions , I confess to you that the difficulty and peril of such a feat startled me ; I reasoned against the feeling , and strove more strenuously than I had ever done before ; I even made a solemn vow not to give way to the temptation , but I believe nothing less than chains , and those strong ones , could have restrained me . The demoniac influence , for I can call it nothing else , at length prevailed ; it compelled me to rise , to dress myself , to descend the stairs , to unbolt the door , and to go forth ; it drove me to the foot of the tree , and it compelled me to climb the trunk ; this was a tremendous task , and I only accomplished it after repeated falls and trials .",
